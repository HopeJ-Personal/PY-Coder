# PY-Coder
Uploading of my original python encoding attempts ive made while learning programming on my own over many years. now that im taking a class for it decided i should have some of old projects also on github for me to look back at once i lose access to the google doc files on my school account with my backups and ðŸ’«shitty historyðŸ’«

## Plan
For organizational purposes and for preserving my prior work in an easily accesable way while moving forward in a more structured way utilizing github repositories features such as logs, push, commit, releases, etc I will split this project into 2 folders:

### Main
> Contains _the latest_ progress, or progress that has been _uploaded_ to the repository _when I am able to, sometime after actually making such progress_

> The files in this section of the repository are __ likely to change with each new release.

> Progress will be made when:
    - I have the basic necessities to remotely access the repository and make "visble", "live", or public progress through various updates and manual or automatic documentation and handling of such.
    - And I can push changes both manually and semi-automatically:
        * Manually, copying or typing changes from a file or notebook into the built-in code-editor in github.com,
        * Semi-automatically, saving and pushing changes from the local/cloned repository on my device to the official github repository via `Source Control` in VS Code.

> Backups are visible and accessible through:
    - Placeholder

> Change log(s) are visible and accessible through:
    - The commits page of the repository
    - [HopeJ-Personal/PY-Coder/commits/main](https://github.com/HopeJ-Personal/PY-Coder/commits/main)

### History
> Contains _previous_ progress, or progress that has been _made, saved to individual files or documents and uploaded_ to the repository _later for _documentation and archival of my previous code to learn from, reflect upon, and visit as I improve my programming skills_

> The files in this section of the repository are _(not)_ likely to change with each new release.

> Progress will be made when:
    - I find previous versions or independently created python projects with a similar or same goal, and theme. This would make them fall under one project, so I will get them, update the repo by creating new folders and files as necessary to add, organize, and or format as req. to enter it into the archives of this project.

> Backups are visible and accessible through:
    - Viewing, editing, and or download your requested file/version or folder/parent and its respective sub-versions from the History section/folder of this Github Repository.

> Change log(s) are visible and accessible through:
    - Manually comparing the differences between each file/version or folder/parent and its respective sub-versions. Unfortunatly as its all apart of the same release github wont provide changelogs for obvious reason but I felt like this was the most intuitive way to store my old versions while not burrying them under changes I make over time (like commits (and there change logs), and releases, should I continue work on this project as I would like to)
