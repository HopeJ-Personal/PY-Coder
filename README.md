# PY-Coder
Uploading of my original python encoding attempts ive made while learning programming on my own over many years. now that im taking a class for it decided i should have some of old projects also on github for me to look back at once i lose access to the google doc files on my school account with my backups and ðŸ’«shitty historyðŸ’«

## Plan
For organizational purposes and for preserving my prior work in an easily accesable way while moving forward in a more structured way utilizing github repositories features such as logs, push, commit, releases, etc I will split this project into 2 folders:

> Contains ___ progress, or progress that has been ___ to the repository __
> Backups are visible and accessible through:
> The files in this section of the repository are _(not)_ likely to change with each new release.

### History
> Contains the prior attempts at building a python encoder (and later both encoding and decoding) in seperate files for each preserved version as is seen in the original google docs file with multiple tabs for each version (1, 2, 3, 3-2, & 3-3)

### Main
> Contains the live progress or progress that has been pushed to the repository when I am able to such as from:
    - An internet enabled device with an IDE or code editor, preferably VS Code which is an ide and removes need for a browser (which is relatively standard on all devices except for those that are not made for direct user interface/interaction such as server's)

> Contains ___ progress, or progress that has been ___ to the repository __
> Backups are visible and accessible through:
> The files in this section of the repository are _(not)_ likely to change with each new release.

> What does it contain
> What makes it different from the other section
> How are backups visible and accesible
> How are change logs visible and accessible
> how often are files changed in here
